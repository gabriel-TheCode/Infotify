## Challenge description

- Load news headlines from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).
- Ability to search news by keyword, language, sorted by popularity, date of publication or relevance.
- Visualize news headlines organized in several categories : Popular, General, Science, Technology, Sports, Entertainment.
- 7 languages supported (DE, EN, ES, FR, IT, NL, RU).
- Show news with the following details :
  - News Title.
  - News Description.
  - Publication Date.
  - Source (Publisher).
  - Since the free version of [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) does not allow the possibility of displaying news content of more than 260 characters, we preferred to load the news via the url provided in a webview and not in a Details Activity which would have been a bit empty.
- Using News API to retrieve news that matches the search
- Save/Delete Bookmarks in database with Room/LiveData
